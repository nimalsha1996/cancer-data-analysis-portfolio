# Cancer Data Analysis Portfolio

## Overview
This repository demonstrates my ability to analyze cancer-related datasets with a focus on
survival analysis and biomarker interpretation for translational research.

## Background
I have a background in molecular biology and cancer research, including lung and colorectal cancer,
with experience in biomarker analysis and clinical data interpretation.

## Dataset
Publicly available cancer datasets (e.g., TCGA or GEO) are used for demonstration purposes.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
- Cox proportional hazards regression
- Biomarker expression correlation analysis

## Tools
- R / Python for data analysis
- Statistical interpretation aligned with biological relevance

## Purpose
This repository is intended as a professional portfolio to support applications for
PhD programs, research assistant, and cancer data analysis roles.
